We do not tolerate harassment of participants (including organisers and vendors) in any form. Sexual innuendos and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including presentations.        
      Anyone violating these rules may be given warning or expelled from the conference (without a refund) at the discretion of the conference organisers.
